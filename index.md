## ABOUT ME
A young man from Thrissur, Kerala, pursuing the 4th year of B.Tech in the stream of Electrical and Electronics Engineering from MES College of Engineering, Kuttippuram. Always curious to learn about the modern world and technology.

As the reknown engineer [Dean Kamen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dean_Kamen) said, 
> Every once in a while, a new technology, an old problem, and a big idea turn into an innovation

So it's always our upon us to make changes in this world. Be that change.

## RECENT WORKS
#### FABLAB COURSE
* **An Introduction to FabLab**

A *FabLab* or *fab lab* (fabrication laboratory) is a small-scale workshop offering (personal) digital fabrication. A fab lab is typically equipped with an array of flexible computer-controlled tools that cover several different length scales and various materials, with the aim to make “almost anything”. This includes technology-enabled products generally perceived as limited to mass production. It was created by an American professor at MIT, [Neil Gershenfield](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neil_Gershenfeld)

  Day 1: An Introduction
  
  The course is conducted by the FabLab section of MESCE and was commenced on 2nd August 2017 Wednesday. The course is lead by Mr. Jaseel, an ambitious man , who descriptively explained about the scopes of FabLab, CNC, and 3D Printing. By the end, simple assignments were given to the students.
  
  Daily Assignments:
  - Create an account in Thingiverse
  - Create an account in Instructables
  - Create an acoount in GrabCAD
  - Create an account in Youtube
  - Create a GitHub Page
  
  All assignments were completed on time.

  Day 2: Getting into GitHub and Introduction to 3D Printing
  
  The second day of the course was about getting along with GitHub and detailed page developement process. After the session, the class was split into two groups, after which we learnt in detail about 3D Printing. Both the mechanical and designing sides of 3D Printing was explained in detail by the supporting staff. 
  
  Daily Asssignments:
  - Develope a desccriptive page in GitHub
  - Upload the daily progress on the class
  
  All assignments were completed on time.
