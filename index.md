### ABOUT ME
A young man from Thrissur, Kerala, pursuing the 4th year of B.Tech in the stream of Electrical and Electronics Engineering from MES College of Engineering, Kuttippuram. Always curious to learn about the modern world and technology.

As the reknown engineer [Dean Kamen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dean_Kamen) said, 
> Every once in a while, a new technology, an old problem, and a big idea turn into an innovation

So it's always our upon us to make changes in this world. Be that change. 

### RECENT WORKS
#### FABLAB COURSE
* **An Introduction to FabLab**

A *FabLab* or *fab lab* (fabrication laboratory) is a small-scale workshop offering (personal) digital fabrication. A fab lab is typically equipped with an array of flexible computer-controlled tools that cover several different length scales and various materials, with the aim to make “almost anything”. This includes technology-enabled products generally perceived as limited to mass production. It was created by an American professor at MIT, [Neil Gershenfield](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neil_Gershenfeld)
